BAD!!
* No install instructions.
* Eclipse dependent.
* Error on initial setup according to instructions.
* What about android specific libraries and setups?
* No instructions on how to install server. Neither how to run it.


Implementation

GOOD <3
* Server supports several connected cameras.
* Client supports any number of connected servers.
* Taking advantage of Android Service, i guess :S... Intents etc.
* It seems to have been fun implementing this :D

BAD!!!
* Movie mode not entered as required. Up to 10 sec delayed, at least 5 sec. 
* Server crashes on broken pipe.
* Images not displayed in proper order.
* If in DisplayActivity and clicks 'Connections' the client crashes.
* Idle Mode option falsely gives the impression one can change display mode from the client
* No mode, display or sync, can be set from client.
* Client does not inform which server triggered movie mode.
* Can't reconnect!
* WOW!!!! Complexity through the roof!
* Way too many threads and monitors.
* Why having ViewThread and DisplayThread?


Thread Safety:

* display.Panel.mBitmap used by ViewThread and DisplayThread without locking.
